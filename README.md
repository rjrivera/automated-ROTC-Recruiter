# automated-ROTC-Recruiter

This is an automated system which aggregates prospects' data, handles critical communication, provides recommendations for department scholarships. 
Utilizing a combination of IMAP/SSMTP services, shell scripts, and python scripts, the system maintains a database backend with minimal interaction. 
Designed to relieve one department of 500 man-hours of labor annually, this project can be implemented nationwide. 

The system receives all information requests generated from the AFROTC.com website's PHP mail system. From there, the server
configured with these scripts will parse all information, provide an automated response to the applicant, and aggregate information in a database.
The department will receive a daily report on all applicants. 

Technical details for server design and implementation will follow shortly.

Operational details and implementation details will follow after a site survey of other detachments.

Projected to function at all AFROTC detachments nationwide, this system should save over 50k+ manhours annually.
